In name of Allah
Introduction
We are going to develop a react based web application to get live scores of football games. It will be a simple panel (only mobile design is needed) with an infinite tab scrolling side to side. Each page indicates a specific day with list of games played on that day. The list of games will be categorized based on their league. You could get a grasp of features in the image below. Ofcourse this is not a 0 or 1 task, so you can push code based on how much progress you have made, but try to implement features as similar as you can (it has points in final review).
